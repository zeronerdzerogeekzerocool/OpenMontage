</div>

> **"LUMINA — Bioluminescent Terrarium"** — a product ad with zero narration, driven entirely by music, typography, and AI-generated imagery. 5 FLUX-generated images, cinematic ambient soundtrack from Pixabay, animated data visualizations (KPI grids, bar charts, comparison cards), and layered stat reveal overlays. Total cost: **$0.15**. No voiceover, no manual editing.

Works with **Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, Codex** — any AI coding assistant that can read files and run code.

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+** — [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **FFmpeg** — `brew install ffmpeg` / `sudo apt install ffmpeg` / [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
- **Node.js 18+** — [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
- **An AI coding assistant** — Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, or Codex

### Install & Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/calesthio/OpenMontage.git
cd OpenMontage
make setup
```

Open the project in your AI coding assistant and tell it what you want:

```
"Make a 60-second animated explainer about how neural networks learn"
```

That's it. The agent researches your topic with live web search, generates AI images, writes and narrates the script with voice direction, finds royalty-free background music automatically, burns in word-level subtitles, validates everything before rendering — then reviews its own output by extracting frames and transcribing audio to catch issues before you even see them. Every creative decision gets your approval.

> **No `make`?** Run manually: `pip install -r requirements.txt && cd remotion-composer && npm install && cd .. && pip install piper-tts && cp .env.example .env`
>
> **Windows:** If `npm install` fails with `ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE`, use `npx --yes npm install` instead.

### Add API Keys (optional — more keys = more tools)

```bash
# .env — every key is optional, add what you have

# Best bang for buck — one key unlocks 5 tools:
FAL_KEY=your-key               # FLUX images + Google Veo, Kling, MiniMax video + Recraft images

# Free stock media:
PEXELS_API_KEY=your-key        # Free — stock footage and images
PIXABAY_API_KEY=your-key       # Free — stock footage and images

# Music:
SUNO_API_KEY=your-key          # Full songs, instrumentals, any genre

# Voice & images:
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your-key    # Premium TTS, AI music, sound effects
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key        # OpenAI TTS, DALL-E 3 images
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-key        # Google Imagen images, Google TTS (700+ voices)

# More video providers:
HEYGEN_API_KEY=your-key        # HeyGen — VEO, Sora, Runway, Kling via single gateway
RUNWAY_API_KEY=your-key        # Runway Gen-4 direct
```

## What You Get With Zero API Keys

You don't need any API keys to make real videos. Out of the box, `make setup` gives you:

| Capability | Free Tool | What It Does |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Narration** | Piper TTS | Free offline text-to-speech — real human-sounding narration |
| **Visuals** | Pexels + Pixabay | Free stock images and footage (API keys are free to get) |
| **Composition** | Remotion | Turns still images into animated video with spring physics, transitions, typography, and TikTok-style captions |
| **Post-production** | FFmpeg | Encoding, subtitle burn-in, audio mixing, color grading |
| **Subtitles** | Built-in | Auto-generated captions with word-level timing |

**The zero-key path:** Piper narrates your script, stock images provide the visuals, and Remotion animates everything into a polished video with transitions, text overlays, and synced captions. Add API keys later to unlock AI-generated images, video clips, premium voices, and music.

---

## Try These Prompts

Copy any of these into your AI coding assistant after setup. Each one runs a full production pipeline.

### Zero keys needed

> "Make a 45-second animated explainer about why the sky is blue"

> "Create a 60-second video about the history of the internet, with narration and captions"

> "Make a data-driven explainer about coffee consumption around the world"

### With FAL_KEY (~$0.50–$1.50)

> "Create an animated explainer about how CRISPR gene editing works, using AI-generated visuals"

> "Make a product launch teaser for a fictional smart water bottle called AquaPulse"

### Full setup (~$1–$3)

> "Create a cinematic 30-second trailer for a sci-fi concept: humanity receives a warning from 1000 years in the future"

> "Make a 90-second animated explainer about quantum computing for middle school students, with a fun narrator voice and custom soundtrack"

## Pipelines

Each pipeline is a complete production workflow, from idea to finished video.

| Pipeline | What It Produces | Best For |
|----------|-----------------|----------|
| **Animated Explainer** | AI-generated explainer with research, narration, visuals, music | Educational content, tutorials, topic breakdowns |
| **Animation** | Motion graphics, kinetic typography, animated sequences | Social media, product demos, abstract concepts |
| **Avatar Spokesperson** | Avatar-driven presenter videos | Corporate comms, training, announcements |
| **Cinematic** | Trailer, teaser, and mood-driven edits | Brand films, teasers, promotional content |
| **Clip Factory** | Batch of ranked short-form clips from one long source | Repurposing long content for social media |
| **Hybrid** | Source footage + AI-generated support visuals | Enhancing existing footage with graphics |
| **Localization & Dub** | Subtitle, dub, and translate existing video | Multi-language distribution |
| **Podcast Repurpose** | Podcast highlights to video | Podcast marketing, audiogram videos |
| **Screen Demo** | Polished software screen recordings and walkthroughs | Product demos, tutorials, documentation |
| **Talking Head** | Footage-led speaker videos | Presentations, vlogs, interviews |

Every pipeline follows the same structured flow:

```
research -> proposal -> script -> scene_plan -> assets -> edit -> compose
```

Each stage has a dedicated **director skill** — a markdown instruction file that teaches the agent exactly how to execute that stage. The agent reads the skill, uses the tools, self-reviews, checkpoints state, and asks for human approval at creative decision points.

> **Web research is a first-class stage.** Before writing a single word of script, the agent searches YouTube, Reddit, Hacker News, news sites, and academic sources. It gathers data points, audience questions, trending angles, and visual references — then cites everything in a structured research brief. Your videos are grounded in real, current information, not hallucinated facts.

---

## Why OpenMontage?

Most AI video tools give you a single clip from a prompt. OpenMontage gives you an **end-to-end production pipeline** — the same structured process a real production team follows, automated by your AI agent.

Edit your own talking-head footage. Generate a fully animated explainer from scratch. Cut a 2-hour podcast into a dozen social clips. Translate and dub your content into 10 languages. Build a cinematic brand teaser from stock footage and AI-generated scenes. **If a production team can make it, OpenMontage can orchestrate it.**

- **11 production pipelines** — explainers, talking heads, screen demos, cinematic trailers, animations, podcasts, localization, and more
- **49 production tools** — spanning video generation, image creation, text-to-speech, music, audio mixing, subtitles, enhancement, and analysis
- **400+ agent skills** — production skills, pipeline directors, creative techniques, quality checklists, and deep technology knowledge packs that teach the agent how to use every tool like an expert
- **Live web research built in** — before writing a single word of script, the agent runs 15-25+ web searches across YouTube, Reddit, news sites, and academic sources to ground your video in real, current data
- **Both free/local AND cloud providers** — every capability supports open-source local alternatives alongside premium APIs. Use what you have.
- **No vendor lock-in** — swap providers freely. The selector pattern auto-routes to whatever's available on your machine.
- **Budget governance built in** — cost estimation before execution, spend caps, per-action approval thresholds. No surprise bills.

## How It Works

OpenMontage uses an **agent-first architecture**. There is no code orchestrator. Your AI coding assistant IS the orchestrator.

```
You: "Make an explainer video about how black holes form"
 |
 v
Agent reads pipeline manifest (YAML) -- what stages to run, what tools to use
 |
 v
Agent reads stage director skill (Markdown) -- HOW to execute each stage
 |
 v
Agent calls Python tools -- TTS, image gen, video gen, FFmpeg, etc.
 |
 v
Agent self-reviews using reviewer skill -- quality checks
 |
 v
Agent checkpoints state (JSON) -- resumable if interrupted
 |
 v
Agent presents for your approval -- you stay in control
 |
 v
Final video output
```

**Python provides tools and persistence.** All creative decisions, orchestration logic, review criteria, and quality standards live in readable instruction files (YAML manifests + Markdown skills) that you can inspect and customize.

```

### Three-Layer Knowledge Architecture

```
Layer 1: tools/ + pipeline_defs/     "What exists" — executable capabilities + orchestration
Layer 2: skills/                     "How to use it" — OpenMontage conventions and quality bars
Layer 3: .agents/skills/             "How it works" — 47 external technology knowledge packs
```

Each tool declares which Layer 3 skills it relies on. The agent reads Layer 1 to know what's available, Layer 2 to know how OpenMontage wants it used, and Layer 3 for deep technical knowledge when needed.

## Budget Governance

Every paid API call goes through the cost tracker:

- **Estimate** before execution — see what it will cost
- **Reserve** budget — lock funds before the call
- **Reconcile** after — record actual spend
- **Configurable modes** — `observe` (track only), `warn` (log overruns), `cap` (hard limit)
- **Per-action approval** — pause for confirmation above a threshold (default: $0.50)
- **Total budget cap** — default $10, fully configurable

No surprise bills. The agent tells you what it will cost before it spends.

---

## Agent Compatibility

OpenMontage works with any AI coding assistant that can read files and execute Python. Dedicated instruction files are included for:

| Platform | Config File |
|----------|------------|
| **Claude Code** | `CLAUDE.md` |
| **Cursor** | `CURSOR.md` + `.cursor/rules/` |
| **GitHub Copilot** | `COPILOT.md` + `.github/copilot-instructions.md` |
| **Codex** | `CODEX.md` |
| **Windsurf** | `.windsurfrules` |

All platform files point to the shared `AGENT_GUIDE.md` (operating guide and agent contract) and `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` (architecture reference).

---

## Contributing

OpenMontage is built to be extended. The two most common contributions:

### Adding a New Tool

1. Create a Python file in the appropriate `tools/` subdirectory
2. Inherit from `BaseTool` and implement the tool contract
3. The registry auto-discovers it — no manual registration needed
4. Add a skill file if the tool needs usage guidance

### Adding a New Pipeline

1. Create a YAML manifest in `pipeline_defs/`
2. Create stage director skills in `skills/pipelines/<your-pipeline>/`
3. Reference existing tools — or add new ones if needed

See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for the full technical reference, `docs/PROVIDERS.md` for the complete provider guide (setup, pricing, free tiers), and `AGENT_GUIDE.md` for the agent contract.
